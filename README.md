# Notebook UI Theme for Atom

Atom wants to look like an old notebook. Like this.

**Let it.**

Notebook UI styles most core elements to make Atom feel right at home in the early centuries. Or in a videogame based in early centuries. Either way, it's what Atom wants.

## Built on Atom One and Fira Code

Notebook UI is based entirely on [Atom One Light UI](https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui) which excels at blending UI styles with syntax theme colors, unlike [other themes](https://atom.io/themes/blueprint-ui). Notebook UI's styles don't mesh with as many themes as Atom One but it looks great with probably all light or solarized syntax themes.

It also relies on [Fira Code iScript](https://github.com/kencrocken/FiraCodeiScript) for handwritten font styling.

## Beautifully archaic

Full-screen using Solarized Light. Atom icon remains in view, just like Atom always wanted.

Settings use rotated hues to help distinguish from other sections.

Find-in-project also uses different hues.

KNOWN BUGS
* No START or PLAY button.

* Playing Nethack in a terminal with this theme is impossibly slow.
